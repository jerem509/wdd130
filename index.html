                Hi everyone! My name is Jonel Charles, from the southwest, naturally paradisiacal
                 part of Haiti: Jeremie. Yeah, you heard it, I am a Jeremien and proud of it, despite all
                sufferings we know in the country this last decade due to political turmoil. Still, I love
                 this country deeply, like a son loves his mother. 
                I am married to a beautiful woman who, with the blessing of the Lord, graced me with 
                two children: one girl and one boy; they are my treasures.
                I love genealogy, a good movie, and have a wish to explore more places and countries.
            </p>
