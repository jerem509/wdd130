                    Hi everyone! My name is Jonel Charles, from the southwest, naturally paradisiacal
                    part of Haiti: Jeremie. Yeah, you heard it, I am a Jeremien and proud of it, despite all
                    the sufferings we have experienced in the country over the last decade due to political turmoil. Still, I love
                    this country deeply, like a son loves his mother. 
                    I am married to a beautiful woman who, with the blessing of the Lord, graced me with 
                    two children: one girl and one boy; they are my treasures.
                    I love genealogy, a good movie, and have a wish to explore more places and countries.<br>
                    <!-- Curently, I am pursuing a degree in Business Management. Surprised? I like programing too, that is
                    why I am taking this course. In fact, I have alread earned a certificate in Business Management. I should be
                    working toward my second certificate, but the new system seems not willing to let me do that. I have some
                    tickets under process. Meanwhile I am taking this software development course, and if next block my issues are 
                    still not resolved, I will earn another first certificate, or my first certificate in software development. Maybe I
                    will declare another major due to that. -->
